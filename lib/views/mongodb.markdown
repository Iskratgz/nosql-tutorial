   Data seem sometimes to have their own life and will, and they
   refuse to behave as we wish. Then, you need a firm hand to tame
   the wild data and turn them into quiet and obeying pets.

MongoDB is a document-oriented database.

MongoDB can be thought of as the goodness that erupts when a
traditional key-value store collides with a relational database
management system, mixing their essences into something that’s not
quite either, but rather something novel and fascinating.

MongoDB is written in C++ and offers the following features:

* Collection oriented storage: easy storage of object/JSON-style data
* Dynamic queries
* Full index support, including on inner objects and embedded arrays
* Query profiling
* Efficient storage of binary data including large objects (e.g. photos and videos)

Argument za MongoDB:

* Replication and fail-over support
* Auto-sharding for cloud-level scalability (currently in alpha)
