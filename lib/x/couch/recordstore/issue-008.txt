Hi!

I added logging to the freshly generated *lib/app.js*:

    var kanso = require('kanso/core');

    exports.rewrites = [
        {from: '/static/*', to: 'static/*'},
        {from: '/', to: '_show/welcome'}
    ];

    exports.shows = {
        welcome: function (doc, req) {
            var content = kanso.template('welcome.html', req, {});

            if (req.client) {
                console.log('CLIENT (BROWSER) REQUEST');
                console.log(req);
                $('#content').html(content);
                document.title = 'It worked!';
            }
            else {
                log('SERVER (APPLICATION) REQUEST');
                log(req);
                return kanso.template('base.html', req, {
                    title: 'It worked!',
                    content: content
                });
            }
        }
    };

Now visiting:

    http://localhost:4000/recordstore/_design/app/_rewrite/

reveals (in the couchdb log and the browser console) that 
there was one server request and two client requests.

I think, that both client requests are superfluous
(or do not know under what circumstances client requests are created).

I also think, that setting the document title with

    document.title = 'It worked!';

is superfluous too.
